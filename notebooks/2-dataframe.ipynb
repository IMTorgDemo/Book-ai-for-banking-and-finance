    "# The Dataframe data structure\n",
    "\n",
    "The data scientist's primary tool is the dataframe.  This data structure enables the user to quickly filter and select records, as well as complete transformations, similar to SQL statements, but typically in a more expressible manner.  Once the data are in the correct format, it can be used as the input for a statistical or machine learning model.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataframe is described as rows of records, or observations, and columns of data variables describing those records.  It was originally implemented in the R language; however, it is now ubiquitous in data science frameworks, such as Python's Pandas, Scala's Spark, and Java's TableSaw. "

    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In the Datascience R versus Pandas debate, it is really an apples and oranges comparison.  R is a domain specific language in the field of statistics, analytics, and data visualization.  This makes R great for consulting, research, and basic analysis, especially within a careful academic context.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In contrast, Python's statistics packages are woefully inadequate and rarely mention details which are of great importance to statistical practicioners.  An example of this is the use of contrasts in linear models.  The different Types (I-IV) of Analysis Of Variance models use different encodings for data.  Determining their estimators is not trivial.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, if you want tight integration with other applications, the strengths of typical programming languages, and want to 'just get stuff done', then Python / Pandas is a great solution.  Pandas is quite good at data manipulation.  Python has the very strong NumPy and SciKit Learn module, which are very good for matrix operations and predictive modeling.  And the Python language is a really good general scripting language with strong support for strings and datetime types."
