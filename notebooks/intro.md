# Welcome to your Jupyter Book

The purpose of this book is not to describe functionality in detail.  This better obtained from the documentation.  Rather, it is to provide a general guide of how math and programming, useful for data science, has evolved over time.  While there are examples, with plenty of code, they are mostly to demonstrate the expressive implemenation of foundational ideas - not to explain the finer points.




This is a small sample book to give you a feel for how book content is
structured.
It shows off a few of the major file types, as well as some sample content.
It does not go in-depth into any particular topic - check out [the Jupyter Book documentation](https://jupyterbook.org) for more information.
